# Interactive_GrabCut

## this is a python implementation of the grabcut method from the paper ““GrabCut” — Interactive Foreground Extraction using Iterated Graph Cuts” by C.Rother et al.

## Also, I modified the edge weights by including the background information. I assume a static background. One can uncomment the code to use the original version of three-class grabcut.
